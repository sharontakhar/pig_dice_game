# pig_dice_game

hi all, 

please check out my dice game, 

the objective is to roll and bank your score (press hold button) the first player to reach 100 or more wins! 

However if you roll a 1, you give up your points and switch players,

I have used JavaScript, html & css to create this game.

My main focus was to master using event listners and functions using this app.

thanks
